## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#64B5F6) to evoke a sense of calmness and focus, aiding concentration for educational purposes. A saturated but not overwhelming shade of blue inspires confidence in the AI's feedback.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E3F2FD), nearly white, provides a clean, non-distracting backdrop for text and images. This maintains a consistent hue with the primary color, avoiding jarring visual transitions.
- Accent color: A light purple (#9575CD) is used for interactive elements, buttons, and highlights, offering a complementary contrast to the blue without being too aggressive.
- Clean, sans-serif fonts for readability.
- Simple, clear icons for rating and navigation.
- A user-friendly layout optimized for educational settings, ensuring easy navigation and interaction.
